1. Signal Processing
  * [Tools of Signal Processing](https://radmerti.github.io/notebooks/Signalverarbeitung.html "Tools of Signal Processing")

    Going through fundamental tools of signal processing using a singal from a 
    smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope. Basic statistical properties of the 
    signal such as whether it is stationary or its ergodicity are checked. Next,
    multivariate statistics such as the (self) correlation is computed and plotted
    over several shifts. Finally, several convolutions are applied in the time and
    frequency domain. A a simple square low pass filter, e.g. sharply cutting off
    higher frequencies in the frequency domain, is applied and compared to a second
    order Butterworth filter which doesn't show the same ringing in the transformed 
    signal.
