   Going through fundamental tools of signal processing using a singal from a 
   smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope. Basic statistical properties of the 
   signal such as whether it is stationary or its ergodicity are checked. Next,
   multivariate statistics such as the (self) correlation is computed and plotted
   over several shifts. Finally, several convolutions are applied in the time and
   frequency domain. A a simple square low pass filter, e.g. sharply cutting off
   higher frequencies in the frequency domain, is applied and compared to a second
   order Butterworth filter which doesn't show the same ringing in the transformed 
   signal.
